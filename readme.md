# ReBuilt, a Java Edition shader.
ReBuilt (ReBuilt Java) is a version of ReBuilt Shader made for Java Edition. It is designed to look conceptually similar with the Bedrock Edition version. But with the capabilities of Java Edition shaders, there are now room for further improvement. Current state of the pack is very experimental, or bare bone for that matter. So yeah expect some bugs and incomplete works...

Any bugs or issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/NickGenghar/ReBuilt-Java/issues).

## Deprecation notice for players playing in 1.12 and below.

This shader pack targets the latest version of Minecraft. If you play on Minecraft version 1.12 and below, some features like block mapping can be mismatched because of how the block naming scheme has changed from version 1.13 onwards. As such, there will be bugs if not incompatibility issues when using this shader pack in versions prior to version 1.13. Feel free to update your game if you want to continue using this shader pack, or look for a different shader pack that supports your Minecraft version.

0.0.11

Current:
Improved dithering algorithm.
Improved God rays. Now with stronger rays when in view of the sun.

Fixed bug in /util/misc/fog.glsl, used the wrong variable "diffuse" instead of "color".

Incomplete, Hard-disabled:
Bloom still disabled. Requires working with HDR.

Known issues:
Normal map and specular map has artifacts when looking behind the object.
No backwards compatibility for LabPBR 1.2 and below. No plans for introducing them as of right now.

BLOOM menu option doesn't do anything. Function not implemented as of right now.

Note:
PBR implementation is rudimentary. Some bugs are to be expected for the time being.

0.0.12

Current:
Added Bloom and the settings that goes with it. Ugly as fuck because yes...

Fixed another bug in /util/misc/fog.glsl, removed "depthtex0" because composite.fsh already declared it.

Known issues:
Normal map and specular map has artifacts when looking behind the object.
No backwards compatibility for LabPBR 1.2 and below. No plans for introducing them as of right now.

Bloom has ugly artifacts.

Note:
PBR and bloom implementation is rudimentary. Some bugs are to be expected for the time being.

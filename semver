0.0.10

Current:
Changed fog and God rays calculation to be done in a function file.
Changed fog calculation to be done in composite.fsh instead of composite1.fsh. Composite1.fsh now reserved for future use.

Incomplete, Hard-disabled:
Bloom still disabled. Requires working with HDR.

Known issues:
Normal map and specular map has artifacts when looking behind the object.
No backwards compatibility for LabPBR 1.2 and below. No plans for introducing them as of right now.

BLOOM menu option doesn't do anything. Function not implemented as of right now.

Note:
PBR implementation is rudimentary. Some bugs are to be expected for the time being.

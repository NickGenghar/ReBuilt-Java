0.0.9

Current:
Added normal map and specular map support. LabPBR 1.3 compliant implementation.
Added DEBUG menu and options that goes with it.

Changed pi to be defined as a uniform instead of a preprocessor directive.

Incomplete, Hard-disabled:
Added snippets for bloom (ugly as fuck) and the settings that goes with it.

Known issues:
Normal map and specular map has artifacts when looking behind the object.
No backwards compatibility for LabPBR 1.2 and below. No plans for introducing them as of right now.

BLOOM menu option doesn't do anything. Function not implemented as of right now.

Note:
PBR implementation is rudimentary. Some bugs are to be expected for the time being.
